# Casino-Outcome-Trends-Sequence-Analysis
Casino Spin Pattern &amp; Outcome Analysis Dashboard – An interactive Power BI project analyzing casino spin results to reveal number frequencies, hot/cold trends, and sequence patterns. Includes dynamic filters and visuals to explore insights, helping identify potential betting strategies.

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes casino spin data to uncover sequence patterns, frequencies, and trends. It includes two main pages:
- **Sequence Analysis** — explores spin order and transitions.
- **Spin Analysis** — shows frequency insights, distribution categories, and key metrics.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Power BI
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Power Query
- Data Modeling & Visualization

## Key Features
- Sequence flows with previous and next outcomes.
- Most frequent and least frequent number insights.
- Frequency breakdown by odd/even, number ranges, and more.
- Intuitive filters and slicers for interactivity.
- Easy-to-read KPIs and visuals.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data Transformation & Modeling
- DAX Calculations
- Visual Design & KPI Creation
- Interactive Reporting

## Summary
This project analyzes casino spin sequences to identify number patterns, frequency trends, and positional probabilities. Using Power BI, the dashboard provides insights into most and least frequent numbers, common sequences, and probability shifts before and after specific outcomes.

## Recommendations
Focus bets on numbers with higher historical frequency for better odds.

Monitor “before” and “after” number patterns to anticipate outcomes.

Regularly update the dataset to keep predictions relevant.

Avoid over-reliance on low-frequency numbers unless following a specific betting strategy.
